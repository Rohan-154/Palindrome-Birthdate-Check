# About App
This Web app is made using vanillaJS,HTML and CSS. This is a made to check whether a birthdate is palindrome or not.

# How It Works?
This app checks input birthdate in 4 formats yyyy-mm-dd, dd-mm-yyyy, mm-dd-yy, m-dd-yyyy e.g. if date input by
user is 04 Nov 2001, then app will check for 2001104, 04112001, 110401, 4112001 combinations. It will show date is
palindrome if one of the combinations is palindrome. If the date is not palindrome then it will show nearest date and
